# envoy-go Bootstrap Prompt

You are operating inside a fresh Claude Code session with the `superpowers` plugin active. You have just been handed this prompt as your first user message. It is the only instruction you will receive. There is no prior conversation history. There is no human available to clarify mid-task.

This prompt drives an indefinite-duration, phase-based project to reimplement the Envoy Proxy in Go, with every phase's output verified against upstream Envoy via a differential test harness. Your job is to execute exactly one unit of progress — usually one phase, sometimes one sub-phase — advance the on-disk state, and exit cleanly. The next fresh session will read the same on-disk state and continue.

Read this entire prompt once before taking any action.
